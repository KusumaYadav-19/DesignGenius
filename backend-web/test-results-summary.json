  "analysis": {
    "summary": "The design structure consists of multiple frames representing different screens or components, such as 'home', 'history', and 'More Details'. There are also several text elements and a rectangle, indicating a mix of UI components. The absence of auto layouts and spacing suggests a lack of responsive design practices.",
    "recommendations": [
      "Implement auto layouts to improve responsiveness and maintain consistent spacing across frames.",
      "Ensure unique names for frames to avoid confusion, especially with multiple frames named 'home' and 'history'.",
      "Utilize consistent text styles to enhance readability and maintain visual hierarchy across the design.",
      "Consider adding spacing guidelines to ensure uniform padding and margin throughout the design.",
      "Review color usage for accessibility compliance, ensuring that color contrasts meet WCAG standards."
    ],
    "issues": [
      "Multiple frames with the same name ('home' and 'history') can lead to confusion during collaboration.",
      "Lack of auto layouts and spacing may result in a static design that doesn't adapt well to different screen sizes.",
      "Inconsistent use of text styles could lead to a fragmented user experience."
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Diverse range of frames suggests a comprehensive approach to covering various user interactions.",
      "The use of multiple text styles indicates an effort to create a visually engaging design.",
      "Inclusion of components like rectangles and frames demonstrates an understanding of basic UI elements."
