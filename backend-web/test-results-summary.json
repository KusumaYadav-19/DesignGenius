  "analysis": {
    "summary": "The design structure consists of six main frames that represent different screens in a user flow, including a splash screen, content upload, content detection, results display, sharing options, and an analysis screen. Each frame appears to be organized for a linear progression through the application.",
    "recommendations": [
      "Ensure consistent naming conventions across all frames for better clarity and navigation.",
      "Evaluate the use of color contrast for accessibility; ensure that text is legible against background colors.",
      "Consider adding component instances for reusable UI elements to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.",
      "Review auto layout settings to ensure that all elements respond correctly to different screen sizes and orientations.",
      "Incorporate interactive components or prototypes to better visualize user flows and interactions across frames."
    ],
    "issues": [
      "Lack of clear hierarchy in text styles may lead to inconsistencies in typography across screens.",
      "Limited color palette might affect visual interest; consider expanding to enhance brand identity.",
      "Inconsistent spacing between elements across frames could disrupt visual harmony."
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "The high number of auto layouts indicates a well-structured design that adapts to various content sizes.",
      "A diverse set of text styles suggests an effort to create a unique visual language.",
      "The overall flow from splash screen to content analysis is intuitive and user-friendly."
