      "Consider reducing the number of text styles to maintain visual consistency across the design.",

      "Implement a color palette hierarchy to simplify color usage and improve accessibility.",
      "Add component instances for repeatable elements to streamline updates and maintain consistency."
    ],
    "issues": [
      "Lack of clear navigation or flow between frames may lead to confusion in user experience.",
      "Potential overlap in functionality between 'Results' and 'Share' frames should be addressed to clarify their purposes."
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of auto layouts indicates a robust approach to responsive design.",
      "Diverse use of text styles and colors allows for a visually engaging interface.",
